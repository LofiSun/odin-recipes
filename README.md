# odin-recipes
This is a practice assignment from the Odin Project while learning how to code and use HTML. The first step in web app development. This project is titled "Recipes".

Update - Coding went well! I didn't run into any major hiccups. Mainly just typos. Doing it three times helped get my skills sharpened.
